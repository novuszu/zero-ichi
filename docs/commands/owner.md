# Owner Commands

Commands restricted to the bot owner. Set yourself as owner with `/config owner me`.

If no owner is configured yet, you can bootstrap ownership from a private chat with:

```
/config owner me
```

or:

```
/setup owner me
```

::: danger Owner Only
These commands have full system access. Only the configured bot owner can use them.
:::
